# How can I convert my NFT into a DPT?
Any ERC721 Token (NFT) can be converted into a DPT using AI Protocol smart contracts. To do so you must have ownership of that NFT

# Instructions
## Option 1: Using Basescan

1. Open https://basescan.org/address/0x63aCBC42e466d29F271c102Bf97A18B52203b308#writeProxyContract#F1 and fill in the details for function 1. `deploySharesContract`. Format:
    ```
    _implementationType (uint8): 0 (This will be zero for every DPT)
    _sharesSubject (tuple): ["collection_address","tokenId"] eg: ["0x303d1e1f43fef1fb8eab940d9c11a203281c5211","7"]
    ```
