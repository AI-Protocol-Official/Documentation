# A Guide to DPT Token Tokenomics

## Introduction
This guide will help you understand the basic steps and decisions involved in designing the tokenomics of DPT token.

### Step 1: Define Your DPT Token Basics
* **Token Name and Symbol:** Begin with something catchy and memorable. The name and symbol are your brand in the crypto world. For a DPT Token, consider something playful and related to personality and character  of your DPT e.g a simpler approach could be to name your token same as the name of the DPT, Harambe DPT can have ERC-20 token named as Harambe with a symbol HMB.

* **Total Supply:** Decide on the total number of tokens that will ever exist. A common strategy for DPT tokens is to have a large total supply (In Billions and Trillions) to allow for a low per-token price, making it accessible and appealing to a wide audience. 

* **Decimals:** This determines how divisible your token is. Most tokens follow the standard of 18 decimals, allowing for very small transactions.

### Step 2: Distribution and Allocation

* **Initial Distribution:** How will you initially distribute your tokens? You can utilise airdrops to generate buzz and distribute tokens to early adopters.

* **Airdrops:** Free distribution of tokens to potential users to build a community and reward early adopters. Decide on the criteria for who receives the airdrop, such as key holders of your DPT, users who have interacted with your DPT, dream creators, users who have promoted/tagged your DPT on social media platforms or referred to other users, early community members, liquidity providers of your DPT Token. A guide on airdrop can be found [here](../how-to-airdrop/how-to-airdrop.md)

* **Liquidity Pools:** An amount of initial token supply should be allocated for Liquidity pool creation. To facilitate easy trading of your token, consider allocating a portion (5-15% depending upon launch price of your token and capital available for liquidity) of the total supply to create liquidity pools on popular decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These pools allow users to trade your token with other cryptocurrencies, providing the necessary liquidity for seamless transactions. A guide on creating a liquidity pool can be found [here](../how-to-create-liquidity-pool-dpt.md).

### Step 3: Mechanics and Features

* **Inflation vs. Deflation:** Will your token have mechanisms to increase or decrease its supply over time? You can  introduce deflationary mechanisms, such as a burn on each transaction, to create scarcity and potentially increase value.

* **Rewards and Penalties:** Implementing rewards for holding or using your DPT  can increase engagement. For example, distributing a portion of transaction fees to key holders periodically.

* **Initial Liquidity Provision:** At the token launch, it's important to provide initial liquidity to enable trading. This can be achieved by depositing an amount of your token and a corresponding value of another stable cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH, USDC) into a liquidity pool. The ratio and amount will depend on your tokenomics and desired initial price.

### DPT Token Tokenomics Template

The Example of "HarambeCoin" ($HMB)

**Name and Symbol:** HarambeCoin, $HMB

**Total Supply:** 1 trillion $HMB tokens, to foster a sense of abundance and fun.

**Decimals:** 18, allowing for fractional transactions.

#### Initial Distribution
* **Airdrop:** 10% of total supply distributed to early contributors and  community members
* **Airdrop Campaign Template:** For Airdrop campaign you can use a point system where key holders, dream creators, users who have interacted with your DPT, social media promoters etc. get predefined points on every activity and at the end of campaign tokens are Airdropped to users based on their points 

#### Mechanics
* **Deflationary Feature:** Each transaction burns 0.1% of the amount transacted, reducing the total supply over time and potentially increasing scarcity and value.
Rewards: 2% of every transaction is distributed among key holders, encouraging long-term holding.

### Additional Considerations

* **Community-Driven Airdrops:** Implement periodic airdrops based on community milestones or achievements, such as social media engagement, dream creation contests, or other participatory events. This not only rewards community members but also encourages viral marketing.

* **Social Media and Influencer Engagements:** Leverage social media and influencers in the cryptocurrency space to promote the DPT tokens. Collaborations can include creating exclusive dreams, hosting community challenges, or even fun "battles" between different DPTs to increase visibility.

* **Community Governance Light:**  Allow token holders to vote on fun and engaging topics, such as the theme for the next DPT contest or which dream creator could receive a donation from the community fund, community can also vote for creation of a certain dream, or some major modification in DPTâ€™s personality or animation etc.
