# A Guide to ALI Agent Token Tokenomics

## Introduction
This guide will help you understand the basic steps and decisions involved in designing the tokenomics of your ALI Agent token.

## ALI Agent AI Meme Coin Tokenomics Template
The template presents "HarambeCoin" ($HMB), a token that combines the widespread appeal of meme culture with the burgeoning interest in AI, creating a perfect blend for a meme coin that stands out. In designing this token, several key factors were considered to align with meme coin standards while also pushing the envelope to foster innovation and inclusivity in the ecosystem

### Basic Parameters
The Example of "AI Harambe Coin" ($HMB)
Name and Symbol: AI HarambeCoin, $HMB
Total Supply: 1 trillion $HMB tokens, to foster a sense of abundance and fun.
Decimals: 18, allowing for fractional transactions.

### Initial Distribution

*   **Airdrop:** 3% of total supply distributed to early contributors and  community members

*   **Airdrop Campaign Template:** For Airdrop campaign you can use a point system where key holders, ALI Token Stakers, social media promoters etc. get predefined points on every activity and at the end of campaign tokens are Airdropped to users based on their points

*   **Liquidity Pool Allocation:** 97% of total supply

## Step 1: Define Your ALI Agent Token Basics

**Token Name and Symbol:** Begin with something catchy and memorable. The name and symbol are your brand in the crypto world. For an ALI Agent Token, consider something playful and related to personality and character  of your ALI Agent e.g a simpler approach could be to name your token same as the name of the ALI Agent, Harambe ALI Agent can have ERC-20 token named as Harambe with a symbol HMB.

**Total Supply:** Decide on the total number of tokens that will ever exist. A common strategy for ALI Agent tokens is to have a large total supply (In Billions and Trillions) to allow for a low per-token price, making it accessible and appealing to a wide audience. 

**Decimals:** This determines how divisible your token is. Most tokens follow the standard of 18 decimals, allowing for very small transactions.


## Step 2: Token Classification

Before diving into distribution, categorize your token based on its primary utility:

*   **Utility Tokens:** Provide access to services, features, or benefits within the ecosystem. They are essential for project functionality and user engagement.

*   **Meme Tokens:** Often community-driven, relying on social dynamics and 
cultural phenomena for value and adoption.

*   **Governance Tokens:** Facilitate the operation and governance of a blockchain protocol or platform.

## Step 3: Token Allocation

Once token distribution model is finalized now you can allocate tokens to different project buckets based on type of token you are intending to launch (utility, meme or governance) and your token distribution strategy

### Utility Token

#### Considerations
*   **Utility and Ecosystem Growth:** Ensure the token allocation supports the development and growth of the ecosystem. Tokens should incentivize user participation and engagement.

*   **Team and Advisors:** Allocate tokens to the team and advisors with a vesting schedule to align their interests with the long-term success of the project.

*   **Community and Marketing:** Reserve a portion of tokens for community incentives, marketing, and partnerships to drive adoption and awareness.
Clarity on Utility: Clearly define and communicate the token's use cases and benefits within the ecosystem.

*   **Vesting Periods:** Implement vesting periods for team and advisors to mitigate the risk of early sell-offs impacting the token's price.

#### Allocation Example
*   **Team and Advisors:** 15-20% - Reserved for those who contribute to the project's development, with a vesting period to align long-term interests.
Ecosystem Reserve: 20-30% - Earmarked for future development, partnerships, and scaling the ecosystem. It's a fund to sustain and grow the platform's utility and adoption.

*   **Public Sale:** 10-15% - Tokens sold to the public to raise funds and distribute tokens widely.
Community and Marketing: 10-15% - Allocated for growing the community, marketing activities, and rewards.

*   **Liquidity Pools:** 5-10% - To ensure there's enough liquidity on exchanges, facilitating seamless trading.

### Meme Token

#### Considerations

*   **Community Building:** A significant portion of meme tokens should be allocated towards community building and rewards to foster a strong, engaged community.

*   **Liquidity:** Ensure ample liquidity by allocating tokens to liquidity pools, making it easy for users to trade your token.

*   **Fair Distribution:** Strive for a fair and widespread distribution to prevent concentration of token ownership, which is crucial for maintaining a decentralized and community-driven project.
 
#### Allocation Example

*    **Liquidity Pools:** 80-90% - A significant portion is allocated to liquidity to support a vibrant trading environment.

*   **Airdrops and Community Rewards:** 2-3% - Distributed to engage the community and incentivize participation.

*   **Development Team:** 2-3% - Smaller allocation compared to utility tokens, reflecting the community-driven approach.

*   **Ecosystem Development:** 2-3% - Reserved for future initiatives that support the token's longevity and relevance.


## Step 4: Token Distribution Models

There are different token distribution models which users can choose for initial distribution of their ALI Agent tokens:


#### Airdrops

*   To reward early adopters, community members, or holders of specific tokens with free tokens. Airdrops can generate buzz and encourage community engagement.

*   Decide on the criteria for who receives the airdrop, such as key holders of your ALI Agent, users who have interacted with your ALI Agent, dream creators, users who have promoted/tagged your ALI Agent on social media platforms or referred to other users, early community members, liquidity providers of your ALI Agent Token.

*   Implement periodic airdrops based on community milestones or achievements, such as social media engagement, dream creation contests, or other participatory events. This not only rewards community members but also encourages viral marketing.

#### Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)

*   To raise capital by selling a portion of your tokens to early investors. ICOs can provide the funds needed for development and operations.

*   Set a clear use case for the token and a detailed roadmap. Offer tokens at a predefined price during the ICO phase. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements to avoid legal issues.

#### Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs)

*   Similar to ICOs, but tokens are launched on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). IDOs can offer immediate liquidity and trading, attracting a broader range of investors.

*   Choose a reputable DEX that aligns with your project's values and target audience. Prepare for substantial liquidity to support trading post-launch. Use social media and community channels to build anticipation and engage potential participants.

#### Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs)

*   Conducting a token sale through a centralized exchange. IEOs benefit from the exchange's user base and reputation, providing a level of trust and security.

*   Partner with an exchange that has a strong user base and aligns with your project's goals. Leverage the exchange's marketing channels to reach a wider audience. Ensure your project meets the exchange's listing criteria and quality standards.

#### Lockdrops

*   To distribute tokens to participants who are willing to lock up a certain amount of another cryptocurrency. Lockdrops can align incentives by rewarding long-term commitment.

*   Decide on the locking period and the amount of cryptocurrency that needs to be locked. Offer more tokens to those who lock more significant amounts or for longer periods to encourage longer-term investment in your project.

#### Yield Farming and Liquidity Mining

*   To incentivize users to provide liquidity to your token's trading pairs on DEXs. Participants earn rewards based on the amount of liquidity they provide.

*   Create attractive yield farming and liquidity mining programs that reward users for adding liquidity to your DEX pools. The rewards can be distributed in your project's tokens, driving demand and utility for your token while enhancing liquidity.

## Step 5: Liquidity Pool Creation

An amount of initial token supply should be allocated for Liquidity pool creation. To facilitate easy trading of your token, consider allocating a portion (5-50% depending on type of token and its distribution strategy) of the total supply to create liquidity pools on popular decentralized exchanges (DEXs). These pools allow users to trade your token with other cryptocurrencies, providing the necessary liquidity for seamless transactions. Following are some core points which you need to consider to create a liquidity pool:

1.  **DEX to launch liquidity pool:** It is very important to choose a suitable dex to create liquidity pool for your token, popular choices are Uniswap V3 and Sushiswap but you go with others as per you your preference

2. **Chain:**  Choice of chain is also crucial for deploying the liquidity pool of your token. L1 chains like Ethereum have very high  gas fees as compared to L 2s, while contrary to L 2s  it has very deep liquidity which is desirable for any new project.

3. **Fee Tier:** If you decide to go with Uniswap or Sushiswap, then the fee tier of the pool is also an important consideration. There are three fee tiers 0.05%, 0.1%, o.3% for a uniswap pool. A higher fee tier gives more incentive to liquidity providers, while costs swappers higher amount

4. **Pairing Token:**  Token which you want to pair your ALI Agent token with is also very critical, more popular choice is a stablecoin like USDC, USDT or DAI, but user can also opt for ETH, WETH or any other asset which has it’s won pros and cons

## Features and Mechanics

*   **Inflationary vs Deflationary token models:** The inflationary token model incentivizes participants through emission of new tokens. Inflation rate / emission rate could be fixed or set dynamically based on adoption and other KPIs of ALI Agent Token. The deflationary model incentivizes token holding as the time token becomes scarce and potential increase in value. For deflationary token models some burn mechanism is used depending on the goals of the token e.g burn on every transaction.
Decide based on your ALI Agent Token’s long-term goals. If you aim for a stable ecosystem with rewards for participation, an inflationary approach with capped inflation rates might be beneficial. For value appreciation and scarcity, consider deflationary tactics like transaction burns.

*   **Transaction Taxing:** Transaction taxes can discourage speculative trading and ensure that token holders contribute to the ecosystem's health. Taxes can be allocated to various purposes, like liquidity pools, development funds, or distributed as rewards to holders.
Implement a small transaction tax (e.g., 1-2%) that is split between liquidity pool funding, development, and holder rewards.

*   **Staking Mechanism:** ALI Agent tokens can have a staking utility for users where users can lock their tokens for some fixed period of time and receive staking rewards to hedge against inflation. Staking also decreases token velocity resulting in stability in price of token
