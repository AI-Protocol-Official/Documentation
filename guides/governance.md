# AI Protocol Governance Documentation #

## Introduction ##

This document outlines the governance framework of the AI Protocol, emphasizing the governance mechanisms at the Smart
Contract level, the governance role of hive creators, ALI token governance, and the handling of governance-related
errors. Our objective is to foster a transparent, community-driven, and secure environment for all participants within
the AI Protocol ecosystem.



## Snapshot Page & Voting ##

The Snapshot page serves as the central platform for governance voting, allowing ALI token holders to participate in
decision-making processes. Here, token holders can view ongoing proposals, cast their votes, and review the outcomes of
past votes. For detailed voting procedures and to view current proposals, visit
https://snapshot.org/aiprotocol/aiprotocolinstitute.eth.

Previous votes include the AI Protocol adoption of the Constitution of the AI Protocol as voted on by the community:

## Guidelines and Governance Section for Hives ##

Hive creators play a pivotal role in the governance of the AI Protocol by managing and maintaining the integrity of the
decentralized applications (dApps) and services within their respective hives. They have the authority to reject
inference requests that do not align with the community's constitution or previously voted proposals. Hive creators can
utilize standardized Governance Errors (outlined in the Govnernace Errors section) to address inference requests that
conflict with the AI Protocol's community governance or constitution, ensuring compliance with established guidelines.

## ALI Token Governance ##

ALI token holders govern the AI Protocol through a democratic voting process, influencing the protocol's direction and
policies. The history of ALI token voting, procedures on how to vote, and the results of past votes can be accessed
through https://snapshot.org/aiprotocol/aiprotocolinstitute.eth.

## Governance Errors ##

In instances where a governing Hive decides not to fulfill a request due to its content not aligning with the
AI Protocol Community standards, standardized error codes (Error 550-558) will be issued. These errors guide and
moderate the content creation process within the AI Protocol ecosystem, ensuring it adheres to the community guidelines.

```
Error 550: Interaction nuances are refined to uphold our community standards.
Error 551: Guides the DPT creation process to ensure content integrity.
Error 552: Curates Dream content to maintain harmony with community values.
Error 553: Shapes Avatar Images to reflect our shared respect and creativity.
Error 554: Oversees Dream Cover Image creation to align with our collective ethos.
Error 555: Guides Background Image creation for Dreams, ensuring a positive space.
Error 556: Assists in crafting Creator Bios that welcome and inspire.
Error 557: Manages DPT Profile adjustments to resonate with our guidelines.
Error 558: Curates Dream updates to foster a safe and inspiring environment.
```

## How to Implement Errors ##

### Reporting and Handling of Problematic DPTs ###

Users can report problematic DPTs through the platform's reporting system. In cases where a DPT violates the Terms of
Service, it may be removed from the dApp, but it will remain as an NFT in the owner's wallet. Keyholders of removed DPTs
can still trade their keys as outlined in the AI Protocol Gitbook.

## Conclusion ##

The governance framework of the AI Protocol is designed to empower the community, ensuring a collaborative, respectful,
and creative ecosystem. By participating in governance, ALI token holders and hive creators contribute to the protocol's
development and uphold the community standards that make the AI Protocol a pioneering platform in decentralized AI.

Please refer to the AI Protocol's Community Guidelines for further information on specific governance actions,
reporting mechanisms, and participation guidelines.
