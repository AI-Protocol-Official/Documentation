# How can I convert my NFT into an ALI Agent?
Any ERC721 Token (NFT) can be converted into an ALI Agent using AI Protocol smart contracts. To do so you must have ownership of that NFT

# Instructions
## Option 1: Using Basescan

1. Open https://basescan.org/address/0x63aCBC42e466d29F271c102Bf97A18B52203b308#writeProxyContract#F1 and fill in the details for function 1. `deploySharesContract`. Format:
    ```
    _implementationType (uint8): 0 (This will be zero for every ALI Agent)
    _sharesSubject (tuple): ["collection_address","tokenId"] eg: ["0x303d1e1f43fef1fb8eab940d9c11a203281c5211","7"]
    ```
