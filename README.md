# Introduction
AI Protocol V3 enables the development of a community-driven, secure, and adaptive, decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) for tokenized AI Systems.

The AI Protocol is composed of elements such as 
* [DPT's](#decentralized-pre-trained-transformers-dpt)
* [Hives](#hives)

## Decentralized Pre-Trained Transformers (DPT)
A Decentralized Pre-Trained Transformer (DPT) is a tokenized AI system with specialized functionality and embedded liquidity, offering a range of services. It can issue unique digital assets, termed “Keys”, addressing the issue of low liquidity in blockchain-based assets.

Any ERC721 Token (NFT) can be converted into a DPT using AI protocol smart contracts. To convert an ERC721 Token (NFT) into a DPT you must own that NFT.

DPTs will have their embedded liquidity termed "Keys", which come with non-custodial embedded liquidity.

**I own an NFT how can I convert it into a DPT?**

## Hives
A Hive is a system that allows DPTs to have decentralized access to AI, storage, and other resources by enabling trustless coordination between various on-chain and off-chain components of the AI Protocol.

Every Hive has the following components:
 * Native ERC-20 Utility Token
 * Hive Smart Contracts
 * Distributed Inference Cluster of GPUs
 * Distributed Storage Cluster
 * Tokenized Digital Assets
 * DPTs
